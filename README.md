#  React Frontend Application Using NASA APIs

This project utilizes the NASA API to provide users with information about various astronomical phenomena.

## Features

- Fetches data from the NASA API to display astronomy details.
- Backend built with Node.js.
- Frontend built with React and Chakra UI CSS framework.

## NASA APIs Used

### Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)

The Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API provides a new astronomy-related image or photograph each day, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.

### Earth

The Earth API allows users to retrieve satellite imagery and other data related to Earth observation missions conducted by NASA.

### Mars Rover Photos

The Mars Rover Photos API provides access to photos taken by NASA's Mars rovers, including Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit. Users can browse photos by rover, sol (Martian day), and camera.
